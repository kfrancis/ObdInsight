Li-Ion Battery Controller (LBC)

The Li-ion battery controller accepts the multi-message query only. In fact, the LBC transmits many
groups: the ﬁrst one contains lots of High Voltage battery data as SOC, currents, and voltage; the second
replies with all the battery’s cells voltages in millivolt, the third and the ﬁfth one are still unknown, the
fourth contains the four battery packs temperatures, and the last one tells which cell has the shunt active.
There are also two more groups: group 61, which replies with lots of CAN messages (up to 48); here we
found the SOH value, and group 84 that replies with the HV battery production serial.

Description: High Voltage Battery’s health. In a factory new condition, the battery’s HX is 100%. The
number is thought to be an indication of battery internal resistance with 100 indicating a new battery with
the lowest resistance. As the value decreases the internal resistance is increasing. As the internal resistance
increases more energy is wasted as heat inside the battery instead of powering the Leaf.

0.0.3 Group 6

Name: Shunts

Type: Integer
Description: Shunts are small resistors that can be switched in to drain a small amount of energy from one
or more of the 96 cells that make up the high voltage battery pack. This is the method used by Nissan
to balance the pack by draining energy from the high energy cells. This works because charging stops to
prevent overcharging the highest energy cell. So by reducing the energy in the highest energy cell, all the
other cells are able to be charged to a higher level. The shunt settings (on or oﬀ) for the 96 cell pairs are
received as 24 groups of four bits for a total of 12B. The shunt order deﬁnes how these four bits (numbered
8,4,2,1) are mapped to the four-cell pairs they are associated with.
